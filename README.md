# assembly_program5
Program generates an array of random integers within a specified range and prints the integers to the screen. This list is then sorted in ascending order, the median is calculated, and the median as well as the sorted array contents are displayed. A separate array counts the number of times each value appears in the array and these counts are also printed for the user.
